### Week-1, Experiment

#### Getting started with Embedded C Programming in ATmega2560

------

#### AIM

In this experiment, you will use UART module in **ATmega2560**. You are provided with a skeleton code of UART interfacing program and you have to fill the functions with the required logic. You are free to define your own functions too.

The program is provided as **MPLABX IDE** project. When you complete the functions, you have to build the project to check your solution.

------

#### SOFTWARE REQUIRED

1. MPLAB X IDE
2. XC8, C Compiler.

------

#### CONNECTIONS

- Connection for Transmission of data
  - TX : RX pin of virtual terminal
  - RX : TX pin of virtual terminal

------

#### PROCEDURE

**Step-1:** To Open the project the project start **MPLAB X IDE**. Click on *File* > *Open Project*, (OR press : Ctrl + Shift + O). Browse to the directory of the Project and click on **ATmega2560_uart.X**

**Step-2:** The structure of the project is provided, and you have to implement necessary logic to complete the functions. After you are finished Debug the program to check and resolve all errors.

**Step-3:** Once you are done with resolving the errors, build the project by *Click Production > Build Project (Experiment-N)* OR Simply by pressing key.

**Step-4:** Once you are done with resolving the errors, build the project using the shortcut key **Ctrl+Alt+F7** or from the Menu bar: *Build > Rebuild solution*.

If there are no errors present in your program, the project will get compiled correctly and you will get the message in the **Output** window as below:

```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 62ms)
```

**Step-5:** Now you have to check if the program you have written gives the correct output. Load the hex file generated into the sample of Proteus Demo and simulate the output.

------

------

#### Simulation: EXPECTED OUTPUT

 **Software required:** Proteus 8 Demonstration (refer Installation Guide provided to you)

------

#### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Upload the **ATmega2560_uart.X** file on the portal.
